+ i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
+ i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . 
+ definetely a great camera . proven canon built quality and lens . feels solid in hand .rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros . 
+ a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 
+ bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . 
+ i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like . 
+ overall i 'm happy with my toy . 
+ in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera . 
+ with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet . and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image . 
+ i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3. do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed . 
+ i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
+ the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . 
+ excellent range of metering options as well . 
+ it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . 
- the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ). 
+ the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price . 
+ the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use . i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos ! 	
+ this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it . 
+ seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want . 
+ it is a very amazing product . i highly recommend it . 
+ i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it . 
- the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens . however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem . 
- the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage . i wish canon would work out some way for that issue . 
- the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . 
+ i love this camera . i am still trying to figure out the may options it has . 
- maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . 
- it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . 
- the grain was terrible . next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .  
- well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . 
+ when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome . 
+ i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . 
- the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
- relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . 
+ contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . 
- now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! 
+ what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware . 
- the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software . 
- what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical . what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it . 
+ i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision . 
+ this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well . 
+ my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time . 
+ manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck . 
+ the service from the supplier was exceptional . the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition . 
+ by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced . 
- about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler . 
+ i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! 
+ the light auto-correction is awesome . 
+ you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right 
- the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . 
- got way too many blurry pictures . i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 ! 
+ takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , 
+ 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera . 
+ it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features . 
- the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . 
- it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button . 
- it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot . 
- unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . 
+ this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier . 
+ i love the quality of the pictures . they look fantastic . 
+ the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there . 
+ i love the eos based controls and easy menus . i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera . many before me have done that already . 
- the included lens cap is very loose on the camera . 
- the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic . the g2 was better in this respect . 
- it had a heavier and more sturdy casing . despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera . 
+ this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! 
+ am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! 
+ very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera . i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged . 
+ the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom . 
- one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all . 
+ the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use . 
+ because this camera is beautiful . the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely . 
+ the g3 looks like a work of art ! 
+ its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen . 
+ i am very pleased with it so far . i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time . 
- you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder . 
- it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? 
+ it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop . 
+ it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! 
+ also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage . excellent idea ! 
- one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough . 
+ i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything . 
+ it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera . 
+ it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly . 
+ the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography . 
- the included memory card is too small . go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense . 
- it is made of plastic . for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience . 
- the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot . his is not a handbag camera . 
- the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile . 
- the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to . 
- this camera has a major design flaw . 
- when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens . 
+ the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer . 
+ the moveable lcd screen is great . 
- the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera . 
- i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better . 
+ very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price . 
+ the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen . 
- the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots . 
+ there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box . 
- after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them .
+ my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared . 
+ the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise . 
+ the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers . 
- the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint . 
- after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent . 
+ it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i .e . organizer ) , and the radio ! 
- i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable 
- the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine ! 
- the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly . 
+ on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life . 
- i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous . 
- since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours ". 
+ tmobile is trying very hard , and again they do have pretty good csr 's . 
+ i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional . 
+ while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it . 
+ i highly recommend a nokia 6610. 
- the volume level of the phone is not all that good . 
- some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to . 
- the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times . 
- the vibration is not top . it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in . 
+ overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned . 
- i am bored with the silver look . 
+ it has a nice color screen . 
- radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in . 
+ t-mobile was a pretty good server . 	
- it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! ! 
- this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it . 
- when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there .
- negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button . 
- poor visibility on the keys . 
- only con i can think of is no camera . ... 
+ anything this phone does , it does perfectly . 
+ this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone . 
+ you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance . 
+ the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly . 
+ you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly . 
- only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing . 
- the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile . 
+ another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world . 
- ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring . 
- the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out . 
- games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games . 
- buttons do seem a little sticky tho . . and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem . . 
+ the reception and sound quality are top-notch . 
+ i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service . 
+ i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .  
- there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient . 
- so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option . 
- other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack . 
- no voice activated dialing
- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones . 
+ one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date . 
- the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless . 
- regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop . 
+ the phone is small , light , and very attractive . 
+ the battery life is amazing . 
+ i highly recommend this phone to anyone . i 've yet to be dissappointed . 
- i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough . 
- in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control . 
- one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work . 
- one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible . 
- the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality . 
- one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610. 
+ im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! 
+ but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! 
+ it practically plays almost everything you give it . 
- i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor . 
+ for the price it is a well spent investment ! 
+ this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways . 
+ it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set . 
+ its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had . 
+ it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well . 
+ and amazon .com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? i 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom . 
+ that 's a rare and valuable feature . 
+ another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . 
+ at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! 
- weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names 
- many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player . i spoke to a rep . at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months . 
- player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 . for the money , get a better quality player . 
+ player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play . 
- i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse . 
- will never purchase apex again . 
- customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them . 
+ for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised . 
- then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all . 
- new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays . 
- i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media . 
- this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it . 
- no way to contact their customer service . 
- very bad quality . 
+ i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites . 
+ i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him . 
+ have used it frequently and have had no problems . 
+ i liked this one enough to buy another . 
+ my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money . 
+ great quality picture and features . 
- they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them . .i am back to using # 1 . 
- nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now . 
- this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas . 
- i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .i am still trying to resolve it four months later . 
- have had problems since the first day 
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it . 
- save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month . 
+ the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me . 
+ i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it . 
- it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation . 
- the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . " 
+ the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting . 
- the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons . 
- i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed . 
- i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode . 
- the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings . 
- having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying . 
+ while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it . 
- do not buy this piece of junk . 
- it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .i can only hear the sound .i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help . 
- i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job . 
- i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked . 
- as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning . 
- won't play a lot of discs . i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap ! some movies it played yesterday , it won't play today . 
- i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! 
- it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working . 
- one stopped working in february and the other in march . 
- amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return . 
- i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems . 
- we had problems . 
- the dvd player does not work properly . 
- the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd . 
- this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before . 
- after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them .the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support . 
+ nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have . 
- unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd . 
- on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd . 
- unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything . 
- another person who had problem with picture after one use . 
+ we tried it out christmas night and it worked great . 
+ even viewed cds full of jpgs . 
- but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture . 
- we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks . 
- i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone . 
- do not buy this player . 
- who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will . 
- frustrating just hope you never lose / break the remote for this player ! 
- we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked . 
- called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ . remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) . 
- poor customer service . 
- i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective . 
- it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced . 
- the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line . 
- i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again . 
- a piece of junk . 
- unit took forever since the beginning to recognize and play discs . 
- 3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything . 
- forget about it ..it 's money down the drain . 
- get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys . 
- after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds . 
- as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale . 
- poor quality . 
- only used for 3 month before it 's down ! 
- i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it ! 
- it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment . 
- the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated . 
- returned after failing to play dvds . 
- i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon . .as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement . 
- the entire unit was poorly crafted . 
- there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board . 
- after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it . 
- the dvd player just would't recognize them . 
- it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .i ended up sending the unit back to amazon . 
+ this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk . i love the aiff , progressive scan feature . 
- now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos . 
- customer service nonexistant . 
- i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed ! 
- they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy . 
+ because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's . 
+ the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's . 
+ it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video . 
+ i find this to be a great feature . 
+ i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great . 
+ for the money apex machines have good features . 
+ it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice . 
+ i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy . 
- avoid apex dvd players - even if they 're free ! 
- now i know why - they are pieces of junk . 
- less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . " 
- same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing . 
- pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run . 
+ best player for the buck . 
+ i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper . 
+ the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal . 
+ loved the slim design . 
- black and white only after 1 month of use . 
- this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared . 
- apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy . 
+ most bang for the buck . i recieved my 2600 4 days ago and feel that this may be the best $ 50 i have ever spent . 
+ it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up . 
+ audio is excellent . 
+ well worth the money . 
+ for the price , an excellent buy . 
+ i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer . 
+ but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it . 
+ excellent second dvd , or first dvd for hdtv ready tv . 
+ simple to use and hook up . 
+ the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used . 
+ this is the best dvd player i 've purchased . 
+ this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong . 
- i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) . 
- i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies . 
+ well , this apex dvd player turned out great ! 
+ it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! 
+ i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds . 
+ i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player . 
+ without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen . 
+ excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players . 
+ remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s . 
+ unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition . 
+ as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine . 
+ it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented . 
+ runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) . 
+ i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price . 
+ most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy . 
+ this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve . 
+ i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! 
+ so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! 
- the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones . 
- it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to . 
- the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue . 
- it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves . 
- the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks . 
- the interface software itself , which should be user friendly , was anything but easy-to-use . 
- the player itself has all sorts of problems . 
- the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so . 
- the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset . 
- the scroll button is overly sensitive at times and not sensitive enough at others . 
- depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive . 
- the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating . 
- the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par . 
- although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product . 
- one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like . 
- the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky . 
- getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience . 
- the instruction manual is very bad . 
- i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 . 
- it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error . 
- music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut . 
- a tad bulky , not the most asthetic looking player and doesn't support a folder stucture . 
- the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality of the buttons on the thing . 
- unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks . 
- the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well . 
- the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it . 
- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones . 
- the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical 
- it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk . 
- had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches . 
- this product is too fragile for normal use .
- the creative software is not real intuitive . 
- the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest . 
- if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly . 
- the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks . 
- seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection . 
- it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want . 
- the cutouts for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel . 
- the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times . 
- quite simply , the firmware and the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time . 
- the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more . 
- the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select . 
- i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance . 
- it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes . 
- navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders . 
- you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division . 
- the software , which comes with player is not good at all . 
- as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly . 
- the scroll bar is a travesty .
- software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on . 
- the software failed repeatedly . 
- software downloads on the site crashed my pc . 
- it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd . 
- the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window . 
- the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt . 
- the environmental audio is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it .
- the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them . 
- a spare battery would have been great . 
- it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players .
- cheap construction , they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners . 
- the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive . 
- as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable . 
- the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd . 
- even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out . 
- it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman . 
- the included earbuds were uncomfortable . 
- the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple . 
- the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful . 
- i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused . 
+ i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product . 
+ the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine . 
- the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity . 
- the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving . 
- the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq . 
- i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with bass boost . 
- the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad . 
- its not really plug and play .
- it is very confusing to start the program .
- what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software . 
- rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . 
- loading cds was somewhat time consuming . 
- my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software . 
- making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order . 
- the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away . 
+ overall it is a great unit and hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it . 
- the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid . 
- it is a little larger than other mp3s but still light .
- it is far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket . 
- it is far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod .
- it does n't sync with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , etc . like the ipod .
- the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes .
- software is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging .
- eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files . 
- i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file , as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 , to avoid hearing digital garbling . 
- does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio . 
- does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library . 
- too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks . 
- my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the year field . 
+ this is a powerful piece of equipment . 
+ it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip , now i just take everything . 
+ the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise . 
- the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display . 
- this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues . 
- mediasource did not recognize my tags . 
- despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax . 
- after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player . 
- mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws . 
- the zen is not a convenient data storage device and only buy the capacity you need for your music collection .
- my goal of using it as a music player and data storage device has not been met .
- the zen does not have a stop button ! 
- the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge and it does not charge by usb cable .
- mediasource did not install on my personal notebook . 
- the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated . 
- the software that came with it was tough to load . 
- i got weird messages about software not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded . 
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch . 
- the top did not fit well into the unit .
- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well . 
- the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen and the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player . 
+ the price / performance looked just right . 
+ the other controls are all very easy to use . 
+ it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist . 
+ it also costs a lot less than the ipod . 
+ the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad . 
+ they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality . 
+ this is a good deal for music and data storage . 
+ on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured . 
+ the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance . 
+ for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison 
+ the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds . 
+ best electronic i 've bought since i was born . 
+ not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy . 
+ very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has . 
+ lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options . 
+ navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch . 
+ also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player . 
+ the screen saver feature is pretty sweet . 
+ another plus in my book , no file limits ! 
+ i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up . 
+ i really have no complaints over this unit . 
+ i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player . 
+ i have no complaints with this mp3 player . 
+ getting files onto it is quick and painless . 
+ then sorting the files is easy as pie . 
+ it holds so much music and audio files . 
+ my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems . 
+ i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again . 
+ way less expensive than the ipod . 
+ bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent . 
+ both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice . 
+ besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either . 
+ ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) . 
+ people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me . 
+ it 's easy enough to use .
+ all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well . 
+ gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary . 
+ now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems . 
+ the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it . 
+ i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there . 
+ the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides . 
+ ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier . 
+ i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer . 
+ being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable . 
+ when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! 
+ the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior . 
+ actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated . 
+ finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy . 
+ i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd . 
+ the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight . 
+ i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price . 
+ just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date . 
+ nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger than the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something . 
+ all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) . 
+ the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative . 
+ transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 . 
+ it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds . 
+ i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players . 
+ despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc . . 
+ first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod . 
+ the player 's software is very easy to use and very good . 
+ compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use . 
+ to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod . 
+ i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards . 
+ naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www .nomadness .net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable . 
+ compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops . 
+ sound quality is excellent , everything you would expect from this company . 
+ the unit is easy to use and intuitive . 
+ it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls . 
+ uploading music is quick and easy . 
+ although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent . 
+ i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . 
+ the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't . 
+ as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible . 
+ structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you . 
+ the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool . 
+ there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization . 
+ the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily . 
+ the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy . 
+ equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
+ i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic . 
+ so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost . 
+ it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx . 
+ the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so . 
+ the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did . 
+ the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate . 
+ the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product . 
+ the software has n't been a hassle for me at all . 
+ i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems . 
+ the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers . 
+ for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ). 
+ it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light . 
+ the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it . 
+ lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy . 
+ excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox . 
+ transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad . 
+ i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer . 
+ huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing . 
+ having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers . 
+ i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of . 
+ i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it . 
+ for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price . 
+ the buttons and interface are very easy to use . 
+ simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use . 
+ with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod . 
+ i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer . 
+ the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine . 
+ the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs . 
+ i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box . 
+ the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
