+ i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
+ i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
+ definetely a great camera . proven canon built quality and lens . feels solid in hand .rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
+ a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
+ bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
+ i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
+ overall i 'm happy with my toy .
+ in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .
+ with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet . and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
+ i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3. do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .
+ i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
+ the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
+ excellent range of metering options as well .
+ it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
- the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ).
+ the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
+ the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use . i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
+ this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
+ seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
+ it is a very amazing product . i highly recommend it .
+ i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
- the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens . however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
- the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage . i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
- the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
+ i love this camera . i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
- maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
- it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
- the grain was terrible . next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
- well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
+ when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
+ i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
- the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
- relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
+ contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
- now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
+ what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
- the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
- what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical . what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
+ i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
+ this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
+ my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
+ manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
+ the service from the supplier was exceptional . the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
+ by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
- about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
+ i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
+ the light auto-correction is awesome .
+ you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right
- the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
- got way too many blurry pictures . i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
+ takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras ,
+ 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
+ it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
- the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
- it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
